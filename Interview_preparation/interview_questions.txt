what is python?  #python is a high level, general purpose, interpreted, and dynamic programming language.
what are the tuples in python? #tuple is a collection of data which is ordered, unchangable and allow duplicate values.

"""Ordered"""
When we say that tuples are ordered, it means that the items have a defined order, and that order will not change.

"""Unchangeable"""
Tuples are unchangeable, meaning that we cannot change, add or remove items after the tuple has been created.

"""Allow Duplicates"""
Since tuples are indexed, they can have items with the same value:
("apple",) -- tuple
("apple") -- not tuple
what is the difference between tuples and lists in python?  #tuples are immutable and lists are mutable; tuples are more memory efficient than the lists.

what is the output of the print tuple if tuple = ('abcd',786,2.23,'john',70.2)
what are the python's dictionaries?

How will you get all the keys from the dictionary?   #dict.keys()
How will you get all the values from the dictionary?  #dict.values()
How will you convert a string to long in python?   #int(string,16)
