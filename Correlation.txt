Handling imbalanced classes :

imbalanced classes implies when a dataset contains data of one particular to be in high than the other by a significant amount where the model tend to predict that particular label as every possible outcome for a test set.
So to handle that situtation we either  go for Upsampling or Downsampling.
Upsampling : In Upsampling we try to increase the data of a class with less instances (minority class) by using SMOTE technique. Where as we come up with a function that takes the data repeatedly from the minority class, with
replacement until the class is as same size as Majority class. With replacement means the same sample can be used multiple times.

Downsampling : When Downsampling we use the Majority class without replacement, until it is the same size of the minority class. without replacement means we use the sample only once.
