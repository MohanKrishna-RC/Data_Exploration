Recommendation engines are data filtering tools that work in the interest of a particular user. For this purpose, they use algorithms and searched data and then
mention it as a recommendation in the sidebar of a particular problem.

Use case : TitTok recommendation system.

It conisders suggestion from both the consumer and producer's side.

Cold start problem :

It provides users each one of different categories of videos  and based on the interest of user, they keep on recommending similar videos.

The TitTok AI algorithm uses collabarative filtering for suggesting videos.

When the algorithm has enough data of the user, it is able to figure out a user's preferences in relation to similar users, and then they will be grouped into clusters.
